# Cluster management and data sharing in Amazon Redshift<a name="cluster-mgmt"></a>

Consider the following for cluster management tasks:
+ Data sharing continues to work when clusters are resized\.
+ Data sharing works across Availability Zones\.
+ When a producer cluster is deleted, Amazon Redshift deletes the datashares created by the producer cluster\. When a producer cluster is backed up and restored, the created datashares still persist on the restored cluster\. However, datashare permissions granted to other clusters are no longer valid on the restored cluster\. Re\-grant usage permissions of datashares to desired consumer clusters\. The consumer database on the consumer cluster points to the datashare from the original cluster where the snapshot is taken\. To query the shared data from the restored cluster, the consumer cluster administrator creates a different database, or drops and recreates an existing consumer database to use the datashare from the newly restored cluster\.
+ When a consumer cluster is deleted and restored from a snapshot, the previous access shared to this cluster would no longer valid and visible\. If access to datashares is still required on the restored consumer cluster, producer cluster administrator must grant usage of datashares to the restored consumer cluster again\. Consumer cluster administrator must drop any stale consumer databases created from the inactive datashares and recreate the consumer database from the datashare after producer re\-granted the permissions\. As the cluster namespace GUID is different on a restored cluster from the original cluster, re\-grant datashare permissions when the consumer or producer cluster is restored from backup\.
