1. On the navigation menu, choose **DATASHARES**\. The datashare list page appears\.

1. Choose **From other accounts**\.

1. In the **Datashares from other accounts** section, choose the datashare you want to accept\. When the Accept datashare page appears, do one of the following:
   + Choose **Associate the entire AWS account** to associate all cluster namespaces in your AWS account to the datashare\. 
   + Choose **Choose specific cluster namespaces** to associate one or more specific cluster namespaces to the datashare\. Then choose one ore more **Cluster namespace ID**\.
