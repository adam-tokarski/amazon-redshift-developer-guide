Amazon Redshift ML makes it easy for SQL users to create, train, and deploy machine learning models using familiar SQL commands\. Amazon Redshift ML enables you to use your data in Amazon Redshift cluster to train model with Amazon SageMaker\. Subsequently, the models are localized and predictions can be made within an Amazon Redshift database\. Amazon Redshift ML currently supports machine learning algorithms XGBoost \(AUTO ON and OFF\) and multilayer perception \(AUTO ON\)\.
